Two files in this repo:

- save_playlists.ipynb
- recreate_playlists.ipynb


**save_playlists.ipynb**
<br>
Will get all track_ids within the current user's playlists and store them into a csv (in the outputs/playlists folder!)
<br>
<br>
**recreate_playlists.ipynb**
Will recreate a selected playlist, from the stored csv. User will be able to select which playlist they want to recreate in their Spotify profile, and the script will do so. (Retaining original added dates is still to be tested.)
